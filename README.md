## General Information
This software is based on DinoDent - a software I originally built for Bulgarian dental practices. Since [DinoDent](https://github.com/thefinalcutbg/DinoDent/) is tightly connected with the Bulgarian healthcare system, I decided to create a clean international version. Its main purpose is to serve as a basis for development of custom software solutions for dentistry in other countries, but even in its current shape it should be totally usable.

## Frameworks and Libraries Used
- [Qt6 Framework](https://www.qt.io/) (6.8 or higher)
- [SQLite3](https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite)
- [JsonCpp](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp)

## Features
- Dental status and procedure procedure input
- Periodontal status
- Patient history
- Appointment schedule
- Financial documents - invoices, debit and credit notes

## Setup
Extract the include.zip file in the main directory of the project. There should be folder named "include" containing sqlite3 and jsoncpp source files. Use Visual Studio or Qt Creator project file to build QDento.
